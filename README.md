# 🚀 OctoCAT Supply: The Ultimate GitHub Copilot Demo v1.14.0

![OctoCAT Supply](./frontend/public/hero.png)

Welcome to the OctoCAT Supply Website - your go-to demo for showcasing the incredible capabilities of GitHub Copilot, GHAS, and the power of AI-assisted development!

## ✨ What Makes This Demo Special

This isn't just another demo app - it's a carefully crafted showcase that demonstrates the full spectrum of GitHub's AI capabilities:

- 🤖 **Copilot Agent Mode & Vision** - Watch Copilot understand UI designs and implement complex features across multiple files
- 🎭 **MCP Server Integration** - Demonstrate extended capabilities with Playwright for testing and GitHub API integration
- 🛡️ **Security First** - Showcase GHAS scanning and Copilot-powered vulnerability fixes
- 🧪 **Test Generation** - Exhibit Copilot's ability to analyze coverage and generate meaningful tests
- 🔄 **CI/CD & IaC** - Generate deployment workflows and infrastructure code with natural language
- 🎯 **Custom Instructions** - Show how Copilot can be tailored to understand internal frameworks and standards

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application is built using modern TypeScript with a clean separation of concerns:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    Headquarters ||--o{ Branch: has
    Branch ||--o{ Order: placed_at
    Order ||--o{ OrderDetail: contains
    OrderDetail ||--o{ OrderDetailDelivery: fulfilled_by
    OrderDetail }|--|| Product: references
    Delivery ||--o{ OrderDetailDelivery: includes
    Supplier ||--o{ Delivery: provides
```

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18+, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, OpenAPI/Swagger
- **DevOps**: Docker

## 🎯 Key Demo Scenarios

1. **Vibe Coding**
   - Implement a shopping cart from a design mockup
   - Watch Copilot analyze, plan, and implement across multiple files
   - Show real-time UI updates and state management

2. **Automated Testing**
   - Generate BDD feature files
   - Create and execute Playwright tests
   - Enhance unit test coverage with intelligent test generation

3. **Security and Best Practices**
   - Scan for vulnerabilities using GHAS
   - Generate automated fixes
   - Implement security best practices with Copilot guidance

4. **DevOps Automation**
   - Generate GitHub Actions workflows
   - Create infrastructure as code
   - Set up container deployments

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Build the projects:
   ```bash
   # Build API and Frontend
   npm install && npm run build
   ```
3. Start the application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Or use the VS Code tasks:
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` -> `Run Task` -> `Build All`
- Use the Debug panel to run `Start API & Frontend`

## 🛠️ MCP Server Setup (Optional)

To showcase extended capabilities:

1. Install Docker/Podman for the GitHub MCP server
2. Use VS Code command palette:
   - `MCP: List servers` -> `playwright` -> `Start server`
   - `MCP: List servers` -> `github` -> `Start server`
3. Configure with a GitHub PAT (required for GitHub MCP server)

## 🎓 Pro Tips for Solution Engineers

- Practice the demos before customer presentations
- Remember Copilot is non-deterministic - be ready to adapt
- Mix and match demo scenarios based on your audience
- Keep your GitHub PAT handy for MCP demos
